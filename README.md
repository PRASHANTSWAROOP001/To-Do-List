# To-Do App

## About The Project

This To-Do app is a simple yet powerful tool to manage daily tasks. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on applying DOM manipulation techniques. This project is a testament to my journey in learning JavaScript and understanding how to interact with web page elements dynamically.

## Learning Outcomes

2. **Deleting a Task**: Click the 'Delete' button next to the task you wish to remove.
